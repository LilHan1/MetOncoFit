<p>MetOncoFit is a data-driven approach that uses biochemical and metabolic attributes to predict tumor differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival.</p>

<p>Visit the documentation to start using MetOncoFit and explore the API. Feel free to submit bugs, feature requests, and Pull requests.</p>

<p>To support the MetOncoFit project, you can cite our publication:
Oruganty, K., Campit, S.E., Mamde, S., &amp; Chandrasekaran, S. Common biochemical and topological attributes of metabolic genes recurrently dysregulated in tumors. <em>in preparation</em></p>

<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>MetOncoFit is a Python package that takes curated cancer metabolic models to output differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival classification predictions and ranked metabolic/biochemical feature importances.</p>

<p>We recommend installing MetOncoFit inside a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">virtual environment</a>. To install the package, use PyPI:</p>

<pre><code class="language-Python">pip install metoncofit
</code></pre>
