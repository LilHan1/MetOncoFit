# MetOncoFit - Metabolism and Oncogenic Fitness

## What is MetOncoFit?
Cancer cells rewire normal cellular metabolism to support cellular differentiation and growth. While several pathways have been associated with cancer metabolism and its increased cellular fitness, there have been no methods to date that describe how metabolic rewiring contributes to cancer. MetOncoFit is a hybrid approach that combines constraint-based genome scale modeling and data-driven approaches to identify metabolic pathways and genes associated with specific cancer tissues.

The documentation is available online at readthedocs and can also be downloaded.

## Installation
We recommend installing MetOncoFit inside a virtual environment. To install the package, use PyPI:

``` Python
pip install metoncofit
```

There are 5 core modules in the MetOncoFit suite:
  * preprocessing.py
  * random_forest.py
  * model_validator.py
  * html_build.py
