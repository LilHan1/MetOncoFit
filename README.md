## MetOncoFit: A Machine Learning Algorithm to Identify Common Biochemical and Topological Attributes of Metabolic Genes Recurrently Dysregulated in Tumors
 MetOncoFit is a data-driven approach that uses biochemical and metabolic attributes to predict tumor differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival.

## Installation
MetOncoFit is a Python package that takes curated cancer metabolic models to output differential expression, copy number variation, and patient survival classification predictions and ranked metabolic/biochemical feature importances.

We recommend creating a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) specifically for MetOncoFit. Within this virtual environment, you can download all the dependencies in the `Setup` folder through a `pip install`. From there, you will be able to run the MetOncoFit package, which is located in the `metoncofit` folder.
